# Machine Learning-based Side-Channel Leakage Detection

This repository contains the code, data, and results for a course project on
machine learning-based side-channel analysis using synthetic power traces.

## Contents
- Jupyter notebook(s)
- sample_data/: example datasets
- sca_outputs/: models, figures, logs, and serialized results

## Notes
All experiments use synthetic traces following a Hamming-weight leakage model.
