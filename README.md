# Machine Learning–Based Side-Channel Leakage Detection

This repository contains the code, data, and results for a course project on
machine learning–based side-channel analysis using synthetic power traces.

The project explores how deep learning models can automatically learn and
exploit side-channel leakage under noisy measurement conditions.

The notebook is the **primary artifact** and contains the complete workflow:
- Synthetic side-channel trace generation
- Hamming-weight leakage modeling
- CNN training and evaluation
- Figures, metrics, and analysis used in the final report
